If you have different types of food in different food hoppers, it seems kinda random how the nutrient paste dispenser chooses which hopper to use to produce a meal, doesn't it? And shouldn't colonists have control over which hopper is used at any given time?

This mod makes nutrient paste dispensers smart so that hoppers will be prioritized based on how soon their contained food expires so that less food is wasted.

Should be compatible with mods that change the size, shape, etc. of nutrient paste dispensers but may not be compatible with modded dispensers. Try it and see.
